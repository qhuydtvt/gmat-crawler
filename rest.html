  Which of the following would, if true, contribute most to defeating the training experts’ objection to the firms’ strategy?
  <br>
   <br>
    A.	Firms that promise opportunities for advancement to their employees get, on average, somewhat larger numbers of job applications from untrained workers than do firms that make no such promise.
    <br>
     B.	In many industries, employees who take continuing-education courses are more competitive in the job market.
     <br>
      C.	More and more educational and training institutions are offering reduced tuition fees to firms that subsidize worker training.
      <br>
       D.	Research shows that workers whose training is wholly or partially subsidized by their employer tend to get at least as much training as do workers who pay for all their own training.
       <br/>
       E.	For most firms that invest in training their employees, the value added by that investment in employees who stay exceeds the value lost through other employees’ leaving to work for other companies
